1. Syntax

PHP's syntax is derived from many languages — predominantly the C language,
but Perl has also had a lot of influence on its syntax.

With the latest object-oriented additions, more Java - like syntax is creeping in as well.
Với những bổ sung object-oriented mới nhất, nhiều cú pháp giống như Java cũng đang dần dần xuất hiện.

Despite incorporating elements of so many other languages, PHP's syntax remains simple and easy to understand.

Source Files and PHP Tags

Even though it is often used as a pure language, PHP is primarily designed as a text
processor (hence its name).

To facilitate this role, PHP code can be inserted directly into a text file using a special set of tags; the interpreter will then output any text outside the tags as-is, and execute the code that is between the tags.

-------------------------
(1) pure /ˈpjɚ/

(2) primarily /ˈpraɪmərəli/
used to indicate the main purpose of something, reason for something, etc.
The game is designed primarily [=mainly] for younger children.

(3) processor /ˈprɑːˌsɛsɚ/
a machine, company, etc., that treats, prepares, or handles something

(4) hence /ˈhɛns/
for this reason

(5) facilitate /fəˈsɪləˌteɪt/
to help (something) run more smoothly and effectively

(6) directly /dəˈrɛktli/

(7) interpreter /ɪnˈtɚprətɚ/ : trình biên dịch

(8) execute /ˈɛksɪˌkjuːt/
-------------------------

There are four types of tags available:
Standard Tags   |       < ?php ... ? >

Short Tags      |       < ? ... ? >
                |       < ?= $variable ? >

Script Tags     |       < script language=“php” > < /script >

ASP Tags        |       < % ... % >

Standard tags are the de-facto opening and closing tags;
they are the best solution for portability and backwards compatibility, because they are guaranteed to be available and cannot be disabled by changing PHP’s configuration file.

Short tags were, for a time, the standard in the PHP world;
however, they do have the major drawback of conflicting with XML headers and, therefore, have somewhat fallen by the wayside. 
Their other advantage is the availability of the short form < ?=$variable ? > syntax,
which allows you to print the result of an expression directly to the script’s output.

Script tags were introduced so that HTML editors which were able to ignore
JavaScript but were unable to cope with the standard PHP tags could also ignore
the PHP code.

Nobody quite understands why ASP tags were introduced—however, if you are so inclined you can turn on this optional configuration option, and you are free to use them.

> Short tags, script tags and ASP tags are all considered deprecated and their use is
strongly discouraged.


(9) de-facto /ˌdā ˈfaktō/
in fact, or in effect, whether by right or not.

(10) portability and backwards compatibility : tính di động và khả năng tương thích ngược

portability /ˌpoɚtəˈbɪləti/
easy to carry or move around

backwards /ˈbækwɚdz/
opposite to the usual way : in reverse
Count backward from 10.

compatible /kəmˈpætəbəl/
able to exist together without trouble or conflict

(11) guaranteed /ˌgerənˈtiːd/

(12) major drawback : nhược điểm lớn
major /ˈmeɪʤɚ/
drawback /ˈdrɑːˌbæk/

(13) cope /ˈkoʊp/

(14) deprecated /ˈdɛprɪˌkeɪt/

(15) discouraged /dɪˈskɚrəʤ/
