Chapter 2 - Funtions

The heart of PHP programming is, arguably, the function.
The ability to encapsulate any piece of code in a way that it can be called again and again is invaluable — it is the cornerstone of structured procedural and object oriented programming.

In this chapter, we focus on the various aspects of creating and managing functions from within PHP scripts — therefore, this chapter is about writing functions, rather than using them.
