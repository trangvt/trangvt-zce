1. Exceptions

Even though they have been a staple of object-oriented programming for years,
exceptions have only recently become part of the PHP arsenal.

Exceptions provide an error control mechanism that is more fine-grained than traditional PHP fault handling, and that allows for a much greater degree of control.

There are several key differences between "regular" PHP errors and exceptions:

• Exceptions are objects, created (or “thrown”) when an error occurs
• Exceptions can be handled at different points in a script’s execution,
and different types of exceptions can be handled by separate portions of a script’s code
• All unhandled exceptions are fatal
• Exceptions can be thrown from the __construct method on failure
• Exceptions change the flow of the application
