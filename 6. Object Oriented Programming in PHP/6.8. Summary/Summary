Summary

PHP’s object-oriented facilities(1) have grown considerably(2) from their inception in PHP4.

PHP 5’s new OOP model makes it possible to build significantly more robust(3) and
scalable(4) applications,
and provides the foundation(5) for creating easy to use, encapsulated, re-useable code.

While OOP is not the only programming methodology(6) that you can use in your applications,
its availability(7) adds a valuable tool to your bag of tricks as a developer,
and its judicious(8) use is sure to improve your code.
