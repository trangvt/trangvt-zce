1. Anatomy of a Web Page

Most people think of a Web page as nothing more than a collection of HTML code.
This is fine if you happen to be a Web designer—but, as a PHP developer, your knowledge must run much deeper if you want to take full advantage of what the Web has to offer.


From the point of view of the Web server, the generation of a document starts with an HTTP request, in which the client requests access to a resource using one of a short list of methods.

The client can also send a data payload (called request) along with its request —
for example, if you are posting an HTTP form, the payload could consist of the form data, while if you are uploading a file, the payload would consist of the file itself.


Once a request is received, the server decodes the data that it has received and passes it on to the PHP interpreter (clearly, we are assuming that the request was made for a PHP script — otherwise, the server can choose a different handler or, in the case of static resources, such as images, output them directly).

Upon output, the server first writes a set of response headers to the clients; these can contain information useful to the client — such as the type of content being returned, or its encoding, as well as data needed to maintain the client and the server in a stateful exchange (we’ll explain this later).
