Chapter 3 - Arrays

Arrays are the undisputed kings of advanced data structures in PHP.

PHP arrays are extremely flexible—they allow numeric, auto-incremented keys,
alphanumeric keys or a mix of both, and are capable of storing practically any value,
including other arrays.

With over seventy functions for manipulating them, arrays can do practically
anything you can possibly imagine—and then some.
